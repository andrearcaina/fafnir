This repository was created as an educational project to learn more about modern microservice architecture, system design patterns, and best practices for building a scalable distributed application. It is my best attempt at implementing a well-structured microservice codebase.

## TODO
In no particular order:
- [ ] Build and design the rest of the microservices needed
- [ ] Add NATS and Pub/Sub pattern for async events/messaging (implement saga pattern)
- [ ] Sketch a basic design of data flow as well as other services (orchestrate events that happen in the app)
- [ ] Add orchestrating/simulation engine or key app events (saga pattern)
- [ ] Simulate load testing with multiple users and services interacting using Locust (simulate real world usage and concurrent users)
- [ ] Figure out how kubernetes fits in (test locally with minikube first maybe)
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for each microservice (going to be a lot of work)
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and docker image builds
